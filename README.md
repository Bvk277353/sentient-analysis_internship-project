SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR REVIEW-BASED FEEDBACK SYSTEMS

In the digital era, user-generated reviews have become a crucial source of feedback for understanding customer satisfaction and improving products or services. This project, titled “Sentiment Analysis for Review-Based Feedback Systems,” focuses on automating the interpretation of textual feedback using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes user reviews and classifies them into positive or negative sentiment categories, enabling organizations to efficiently extract insights from large volumes of feedback data. The proposed model employs text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization, followed by feature extraction using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) method. A Logistic Regression algorithm is then trained on the IMDb movie reviews dataset to perform sentiment classification. Experimental results demonstrate an accuracy of approximately 90%, indicating that the model effectively captures sentiment polarity in textual data. This sentiment analysis framework can be integrated into real-world feedback systems to support decision-making, enhance customer relationship management, and monitor public perception automatically and efficiently
